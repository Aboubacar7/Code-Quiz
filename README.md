# CodeQuiz
 I am taking a code quiz
 I can click the start button
A timer starts and I am presented with a question
I can answer a question
I am presented with another question
when I answer a question incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
I can save my initials and my score
